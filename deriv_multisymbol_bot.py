Deriv Multi-Symbol Rise/Fall Trading Bot - FULL POWER  v2
==========================================================
Single-file bot. Scans all eligible synthetic-index symbols, runs an
18-layer intelligence pipeline per symbol using fitted statistical models,
fuses evidence via Bayesian log-odds combination, auto-selects trade
duration via Monte Carlo simulation, and trades the single strongest
signal with a balance-scaled martingale.

v2 FIXES (applied 2026-06-29 from live log + Supabase analysis):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FIX 1 — hurst_rs() now computed on LOG-RETURNS not absolute prices.
         Root cause of H=1.0 on every tick, which caused hurst_signal=+1.0
         always and forced momentum_mode=True permanently, injecting a
         structural CALL-only bias into every Bayesian fusion.

FIX 2 — hmm_trend_weight() lean now normalised by return std.
         HMM state means are O(1e-4) for synthetic index returns; tanh(1e-4
         × 200) ≈ 0.02 — the HMM layer was effectively silent. Normalising
         by std makes the signal dimensionless and reaches ±1 naturally.

FIX 3 — compute_adx() trend threshold lowered 20 → 12 for tick data.
         Tick-level ADX on synthetics rarely exceeds 20, so trend_strength
         was permanently 0 and adx_dir contributed nothing to the gate.

FIX 4 — momentum_mode h-threshold raised 0.52 → 0.58.
         True random-walk synthetics have H ≈ 0.50 ± 0.05 on returns.
         The 0.52 threshold was inside measurement noise, enabling spurious
         momentum mode even on genuinely mean-reverting regimes.

FIX 5 — Direction balance correction in bayesian_fusion().
         When recent CALL/PUT ratio exceeds 80/20, a soft log-odds penalty
         (capped at ±0.5) dampens runaway one-sided bias as a safety net.

FIX 6 — MARTINGALE_MAX_STEPS reduced 3 → 2 + MAX_SEQUENCE_LOSS_PCT guard.
         3-step martingale at 2% risk could consume 11.4% of balance per
         failed sequence. Hard cap at 5% of balance aborts the sequence
         before it can destroy the account. This is the structural fix for
         the $12,000 → $7.54 account destruction.

FIX 7 — POST_LOSS_DEEP_RECAL disabled (False).
         Every loss was triggering 688-second full recalibration (11.5 min),
         locking trading after each of the 41% losing trades. The scheduled
         2-hour recal is sufficient; per-loss recal was redundant and was
         calibrating on corrupted Hurst features anyway.

FIX 8 — MIN_EXP_WIN_RATE lowered 0.52 → 0.505.
         MC was blocking 186 signals because genuine random-walk synthetics
         only simulate to ~0.50-0.51. The layer gate does primary selection;
         MC's role is to pick the best duration, not gate the trade.

FIX 9 — MC_SIMULATIONS reduced 50000 → 8000.
         Statistical error at 8000 paths = ±0.006, sufficient to distinguish
         0.52 from 0.505. Reduces calibration time by ~80%.

FIX 10 — Walk-forward folds 5 → 3, step 3 → 5.
          Cuts calibration wall time from ~688s to ~200-250s.

FIX 11 — Direction history tracking (last 30 trades) for bias monitoring.
          Logs a warning when CALL/PUT ratio exceeds 80/20.

MODEL FITTING vs LIVE SCORING
------------------------------
Fitting HMM/GARCH/Hawkes/OU is computationally expensive, so it only happens
during calibration: once at startup (full universe), then every 2 hours
(top-K deep dive) or after 2 consecutive losses on a symbol (rate-limited,
that symbol's deep dive). Live trading between calibrations just evaluates
the cached fitted models against new ticks - cheap, fast, no refitting.

Symbols without a fitted model yet (before their first calibration) return
no signal and are simply not eligible for selection - this is automatic
and correct, no special-casing needed.

CONNECTION: new Deriv Options API (REST OTP bootstrap), verified against
developers.deriv.com as of 2026-06:
    REST  GET  /trading/v1/options/accounts            -> resolve account_id
    REST  POST /trading/v1/options/accounts/{id}/otp    -> pre-auth WS URL
    No `authorize` message needed - the OTP URL is already authenticated.
    OTP tokens are short-lived/single-use, so a fresh one is fetched on
    every (re)connect; the client auto-reconnects with backoff and replays
    subscriptions (balance + ticks for every symbol) after each reconnect.
    `active_symbols` no longer accepts `product_type`; its response field
    is `underlying_symbol` (not `symbol`). `contracts_for` no longer takes
    `currency`. Buy `parameters` now requires `underlying_symbol` (not
    `symbol`). Tick responses keep the `symbol` field unchanged.

ENV VARS REQUIRED:
    DERIV_APP_ID        - your app_id from a NEW developers.deriv.com application
                           (legacy app_ids, e.g. the old demo id 1089, do NOT
                           work with the new Options API)
    DERIV_API_TOKEN     - API token (personal access token) for your Deriv account
    DERIV_ACCOUNT_TYPE  - "demo" (default, safe) or "real". Picked explicitly
                           rather than guessed, so the bot never trades on
                           your real-money account by accident.
    DERIV_ACCOUNT_ID    - optional; skips the accounts lookup and uses this
                           account_id directly

SUPABASE PERSISTENCE (Railway has no persistent filesystem):
    SUPABASE_URL        - e.g. https://xxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co
    SUPABASE_KEY        - service_role key from Supabase Settings → API

    Deriv synthetic indices are at floating-point noise level (O(0.0001)).
    PDM and NDM at that resolution are also O(0.0001), making ATR≈0 and
    producing ADX≈0 regardless of actual trend strength.

    Fix: aggregate raw ticks into `bar_size`-tick bars (same approach used
    by multi_timeframe_confluence) before computing ADX. At 5-tick bars the
    bar-to-bar price differences are O(0.001-0.01) — large enough for ATR
    to be non-zero and for PDM/NDM to carry directional information.
